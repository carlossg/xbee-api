 *  
 * This is an API for XBee 802.15.4 and ZNet radios
 * 
 * Objectives: 
 * 	Focus on support for a single version of firmware for both ZNet and 802.15.4 XBee radios; this would likely be the latest stable. 
 * 	Implement functionality to meet an expected 80% of usage
 *  Strive for correctness and reliability over percentage of features implemented
 *  
 * Disclaimers: 
 *  This software should be considered experimental/untested.
 *  I can't commit to supporting for any length of time (that's one reason it's open source).
 *  I also can't commit to providing technical support but will attempt to provide help where possible.
 *  I recommend you are familiar with Java and basic electronics before investing in this API such that
 *  you are comfortable with maintaining it to support your objectives; although it is my intention to support this project
 *  I won't be able to commit to backwards compatibility until possibly once the API reaches a level of maturity.
 *  
 * Notes:
 * This API has been developed and tested with rxtx-2.1-7r2 on windows and mac. Other versions/OSes may
 * work.
 * 
 * The API mode classes are designed for escaped byte mode (AP=2).  This applies to both varieties of XBee (ZigBee and 802.14.5).
 * Use of API without correct AP mode may result in some errors, or lots of errors.
 *  
 * Unfortunately I don't have a good solution in place for regression testing.  Since this API depends on hardware,
 * there can be significant work in configuration/setup/test iterations required to test all functionality.  That said
 * I may have broken previously working stuff.
 * 
 * Please send feedback to email address listed below
 * 
 * TODO add gpl license to all source code files
 * TODO XBee Server to share api/radio with multiple apps
 * TODO simple ant build to create JAR file/dist
 * TODO ZNet Cluster ID
 * TODO Test on linux
 * TODO testNG framework for unit tests
 * 
 * Windows users: To locate your COM port on windows, go to Start->(right-click)My Computer->Manage, then Select Device Manager and Ports
 * 
 * This is disappointing: "The WR command should be used sparingly. The EM250 supports a limited number of write cycles.“ How many is limited??
